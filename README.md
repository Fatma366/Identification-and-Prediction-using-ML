# What are we doing? (And why?)

## Problem
The lack of sufficient and open scientific data on Kenyan coconut diseases demands a comprehensive documentation effort. Identifying the bacterial pathogens behind these diseases is essential for effective disease management.

## Solution
- We propose to harness the power of machine learning models to achieve accurate detection and prediction of coconut yellowing diseases along Kenya's coastline.
- Submission of generated genomic data to public databases 

## Unique Value Proposition
Our project stands out by combining advanced DNA analysis, machine learning techniques, and indigenous knowledge. This unique blend allows us to tackle the challenges posed by coconut yellowing diseases effectively.

### Objectives
- Submit genomic data to a public data base
- Build a cat boost model to predict coconut yellowing disease (CYD) based on the bacterial diversity

### Data
The data for this study is 16SrRNA  dataset from yellowing diseased coconut plants from the Kenyan coast

## KeyMetrics
- Availing our data to a public data base
- Accuracy of machine learning models


## TargetUserProfiles
- Agricultural researchers
- Government agencies
- Coconut farmers
- Kenya Coconut Development Authority (KCDA)

## ResourcesRequired
- Bioinformatics tools
- Machine learning frameworks (Python libraries)
- Contributors from diverse backgrounds
