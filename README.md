# Introduction

## Problem
The lack of sufficient scientific data on Kenyan coconut diseases demands a comprehensive documentation effort. Identifying the bacterial pathogens behind these diseases is essential for effective disease management.

## Solution
We propose to harness the power of cutting-edge DNA analysis and machine learning models to achieve accurate detection and prediction of coconut yellowing diseases along Kenya's coastline.

## Unique Value Proposition
Our project stands out by combining advanced DNA analysis, machine learning techniques, and indigenous knowledge. This unique blend allows us to tackle the challenges posed by coconut yellowing diseases effectively.

### Objectives
- Build pipeline that can predict coconut yellowing disease (CYD) based on the bacterial diversity
- Discriminate between the CYD samples in the three counties using the bacterial diversity
- Discriminate between the CYD samples and healthy control samples using the bacterial diversity
- Identify the bacteria biomarkers associated with CYD

### Data
The data for this study is 16SrRNA  dataset from yellowing diseased coconut plants from the Kenyan coast

## KeyMetrics
- Accuracy of machine learning models
- Predicted susceptibility of pathogens

## TargetUserProfiles
- Agricultural researchers
- Government agencies
- Coconut farmers
- Kenya Coconut Development Authority (KCDA)

## ResourcesRequired
