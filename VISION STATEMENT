VISION STATEMENT
I am working with my mentors Elisee Jafsia and Umar Ahmad.
Utilizing the power of machine learning models, XgBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, to revolutionize the detection and classification of genetic variants in bacteria colonizing yellowing diseases in coconut palms along the Kenyan coast. 

This research addresses the critical problem of accurately identifying these pathogens and assessing their diversity, ultimately contributing to effective disease control measures. 
Openness and open leadership, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing will all provide a dynamic research environment where diverse perspectives converge to harness the full potential of machine learning in agricultural pathology. 
Advancing my expertise in machine learning will help make meaningful contributions to the scientific community hence enhance my ability to address complex challenges posed by bacterial pathogens in coconuts. 
My cultural goals for the community, organization, and project are intrinsically linked to problem-solving. 
Fostering inclusivity for a supportive ecosystem through a strong cultural foundation that promotes a resilient and sustainable agricultural landscape.
