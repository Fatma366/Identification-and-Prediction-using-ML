## 16S rRNA gene V4 region of yellowing diseased coconut plants

The Q25 sequence data originating from the sequencing of yellowing diseased coconut plants' 16S rRNA gene V4 region was analyzed using 
the MR DNA ribosomal and functional gene analysis pipeline. During this process, sequences underwent primers removal, exclusion of 
short sequences (<150bp), elimination of ambiguous base calls, and quality filtering with a maximum expected error threshold of 1.0. 
The sequences were then dereplicated to retain unique ones, followed by denoising, removal of sequences with sequencing or PCR errors, 
and chimera elimination, resulting in denoised sequences or OTUs. The final OTUs were subjected to taxonomic classification using BLASTn 
against a curated NCBI database, leading to the creation of "counts" files for each taxonomic level. 
This process produced both the OTU-Bacteria Taxonomy and the OTU-table.
