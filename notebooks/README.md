### Using ID-and-Prediction-using-ML Notebooks
Welcome to the notebooks folder of Identification-and-Prediction-using-ML.  This folder contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrate various aspects of the project ML steps. The notebook is designed to showcase a different feature or technique, and includes detailed instructions. 

The notebook contains comments that will help you follow the commands easily. Make sure to do modifications if needed for your data.
After the preprocessing, you will use **machine_learning_models** notebook. This notebook contains the three machine learning models used in this project: Random Forest, SVM and CatBoost. All the step that were listed on the workflow after the three models are here on the notebook. It also provide the top 20 features extracted by each model and a Venn diagram. In addition, the accurary and the evaluation metrics and the training time will be generated. 

*To use the Python notebooks in this folder, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your machine and the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file. Install Python from the official website and use pip to install the packages by running pip **install -r requirements.txt** command in your terminal.*
