### Using ID-and-Prediction-using-ML Notebooks
Welcome to the notebooks folder of Identification-and-Prediction-using-ML.  This folder contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various aspects of the project ML steps. The notebook is designed to showcase a different feature or technique, and includes detailed instructions. 

The notebook contains comments that will help you follow the commands easily. Make sure to do modifications if needed for your data.
After the preprocessing, the data was subjected to three machine learning models in this project: Random Forest, SVM and CatBoost. All the steps that were listed on the workflow  after the three models are here on the notebook. It also provide the top 20 features extracted by each model and a Venn diagram. In addition, the accurary and the evaluation metrics and the training time will be generated. 

You can check out the [Pipeline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uxL4N2hO3fugtohfougj5jrNV-Ge1Sr1/edit#slide=id.p1) used.

*To use the Python notebooks in this folder, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your machine and the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file. Install Python from the official website and use pip to install the packages by running pip **install -r requirements.txt** command in your terminal.*
